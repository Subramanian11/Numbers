An deficient number is a number where the sum of all its proper factors is lesser than the original number. 

Eg:

Input: 21

Output: Yes

Explanation: 
  
  Factors of 21 are 1,3 and 7.
  Proper factor includes 1,3 and 7 but does not include the 21 own divisor
  sum of proper factors: 11 is lesser than the input number.
  So it is a deficient number.
  
Input: 18

Output: Yes

Explanation: 
  
  Factors of 18 are 1,2,3,6,9,18
  Proper factor includes 1,2,3,6,9 but does not include the 18 own divisor
  sum of proper factors: 21 is not lesser than the input number.
  So it is not a deficient number.

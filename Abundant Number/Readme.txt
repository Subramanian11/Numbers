An abundant number is a number where the sum of all its proper factors is larger than the original number. 

Eg:

Input: 18

Output: Yes

Explanation: 
  
  Factors of 18 are 1,2,3,6,9,18
  Proper factor includes 1,2,3,6,9 but does not include the 18 own divisor
  sum of proper factors: 21 is larger than the input number.
  So it is an abundant number.

Input: 6

Output: No

Explanation: 
  
  Factors of 6 are 1,2,3,6
  Proper factor includes 1,2,3 but does not include the 6 own divisor
  sum of proper factors: 6 is not larger than the input number.
  So it is not an abundant number.

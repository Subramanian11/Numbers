The sum of all the given digits of a number and the reverse of that sum is multiplied, which is equal to the original number, 
and then the number is called a magic number.

Example:
For example, suppose we have a 1729 number and we need to validate whether the number is a magic number or not. 

So, first we need to get the sum of all digits of the number which is 19 (1 + 7 + 2 + 9 = 19). 
Reverse the sum of the number is 91, and then 
get the product of the sum of original digits with the reverse of that sum as 19 * 91 = 1729. 
So, it is the magic number.

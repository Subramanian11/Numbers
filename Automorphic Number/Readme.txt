A number is called an Automorphic number if and only if its square ends in the same digits as the number itself.

Means that input number need to squared.
Then squared number should ends with tha input number.

Examples : 

Input  : N = 76 
Output : Automorphic
Explanation: As 76*76 = 5776
here the sqaure of 76 is 5776, the number ends with 76.

Input  : N = 25
Output : Automorphic
As 25*25 = 625
here the sqaure of 25 is 625, the number ends with 25.
